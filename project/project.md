# Project

The purpose of the project is for you to dive deeper into any of the topics covered in the course. Depending on your background and prior experience, possible project ideas include but not limited to:
- Re-implementing an algorithm from a paper and tweaking it.
- Diving deeper into various concepts covered in the course and perform a comparative/trade-off study on some representative systems.
- Applying techniques learned in this class to an application motivated by real-world system.
- Using techniques from this course for your current (PhD/MS) research topic.



Note that you do not need to implement things from scratch. It is encouraged to utilize any material from your homework or demos from the course, material from other courses, and use open-source material. Of course, proper acknowledgment/referencing must be given.

You may work on the project individually or in groups of 2. For group projects, the expectation is that the project should be larger in scope compared to an individual project, and that the activities of each group member and the collaboration plan are clearly scoped out. See proposal section for more details.


## Proposal
**Due week 5**.
In your proposal, you should propose your project idea and outline the activities you plan to carry out.
Your project proposal should be concise, clear, and well-structured, spanning around 1 but no more than 2 pages. 2 pages should be more than sufficient, including any figures or tables.
Below are the key components to include and tips to help you craft a compelling proposal.

**NOTE:** Your project must have a clear connection to the material covered in this course. For example, a project on only learning a neural controller (e.g., end-to-end controller) is not allowed. But it is okay if the neural controller is, for example, compared to a trajectory optimizer and a trade-off study is performed, or CBF/CLF concepts are incorporated into the development of the neural controller to achieve some desirable behavior.

**NOTE:** You are welcome to combine this project with another course project this quarter. However, you must clearly scope out which part of the project belongs to this course, and which parts belong to the other course. Also describe which components are common to the projects (e.g., you are using the same simulation evironment). Understandably, you cannot submit the same body of work to different courses.

**1. Title and Team Information**
- Provide a descriptive and engaging title for your project.
- List the names of all team members (if applicable).

**2. Motivation and Background**
- Briefly explain the motivation behind your project. Why is this topic important or interesting?
- Provide relevant background information to contextualize your project. Highlight connections to course topics or real-world applications.

**3. Objective**
- Describe the problem you seek to solve.
- Clearly state the goal(s) of your project. What do you aim to achieve by the end of the project?
- Are there questions you hope to answer by performing this project?

**4. Proposed Approach**
- Outline the methods, techniques, or tools you plan to use. Be specific about how you will approach the problem or topic.
- Define the scope of your project. What will you focus on, and what is outside the scope?
- Describe how you plan to evaluate your technique, or outline the experiments you plan to perform.
- If applicable, mention any datasets, software, or frameworks you intend to use.

**5. Timeline**
- Provide a high-level week-by-week timeline or milestones for your project. Break it down into phases (e.g., research, implementation, testing, and finalization). Note: You will need to give a lightning pitch and poster in week 10, and a final report during finals week.

**6. Collaboration Plan (for group projects)**
- If working in a group, describe how tasks will be divided among team members.
- Include a brief plan for how you will collaborate and ensure accountability.

**7. Project scope (for projects overlapping with another course)**
- If you are combining your course project with another course, describe which part of the project belongs to this course, and how efforts for that part will be different from the rest of the project.
- If applicable, describe the synergies between this course and the other course(s).

**8. References**
- Cite any papers, resources, or tools you plan to use as part of your project.

**Tips**
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague statements. Clearly articulate your ideas and plans.
- **Stay Focused:** Ensure your proposal aligns with the course topics and is feasible within the given timeframe.
- **Use Visuals (Optional):** Simple diagrams or charts can help convey your ideas more effectively.
- **Proofread:** Check for clarity, grammar, and formatting before submission.

## Lightning pitch

**Happening during Monday week 10**

You will be required to give a lightning pitch (a.k.a. spotlight talk) to the rest of the class.
Given the current enrollment, you will have less than 2 minutes.

Your pitch should be catchy, concise, and accessible to a general audience. Use of slides is optional.


The **RISE** framework is a simple approach to constructing an effective pitch.

**R**elevance: Quickly establish how the topic is relevant to the audience.

**I**ssue: State what the issue is. Or it can also be the questions or challenges you seek to tackle.

**S**olution: Describe the solution you are proposing to resolve the issue.

**E**vidence: Provide the evidence to show that your solution has successfully addressed the issues.

## Poster session
**Happening during Wednesday week 10**

We will have a poster session during regular class time. There will be two sessions ~35 minutes each where one half of the course is presenting the poster and the other half will go check out the posters. Then the two halves will swap.

Students will be assigned posters to peer review and provide feedback to their peers.

## Why writing compelling proposals are important
Writing compelling project proposals is crucial because it helps articulate your ideas clearly, demonstrates the feasibility of your project, and secures approval or support from stakeholders whether you end up in academia or industry. A well-written proposal can also showcase your understanding of the subject matter and your ability to plan and execute a project effectively. Going through the process of writing a proposal forces you to really think about the problem, organize your thoughts, and develop a well-reasoned plan before starting the project. Not writing a proposal is like starting to code up something without knowing what what your code should be doing!

In the near and distant future, you may find yourself needing to write a proposal. For example, as a researcher or start-up founder applying for external funding, an employee of a company applying to secure a contract/project with another company seeking service, or convincing your team to pursue your idea. Other examples include:
- Writing a research statement for PhD applications.
- Applying for research grants or funding opportunities (e.g., fellowships, seed funding).
- Pitching a new project idea to your team or organization.
- Seeking approval for a thesis or dissertation topic.
- Collaborating with external partners or institutions on joint projects.
- Proposing a new feature or product in a professional setting.

By crafting a compelling proposal, you can effectively communicate your vision, gain buy-in, and set the stage for a successful project.
Naturally, in academic settings, writing compelling proposals is key to securing research funding, fellowships, and convincing decision-makers to support your research activities.
While this course project is relatively low-stakes, this is a good opportunity to get some practice on setting a research/project vision and articulating it clearly in written form.

## Why an effective lightning pitch is important
A lightning pitch is a concise and engaging way to present your project idea to an audience. It is important because it forces you to distill your project into its most essential elements, making it easier for others to quickly understand your goals, approach, and significance. A strong lightning pitch can:

- Capture the audience's attention and generate interest in your project.
- Help you practice clear and effective communication of complex ideas.
- Provide an opportunity to receive immediate feedback and refine your project direction.
- Showcase your ability to think critically and present your work confidently.

In professional and academic settings, the ability to deliver a compelling lightning pitch is a valuable skill, whether you're presenting to potential collaborators, stakeholders, or funding committees. Often times, you have very limited time to communicate your idea and convince you audience why they should continue to pay attention to you (e.g., have a follow up meeting, invest in your company, etc.)



## Resources on proposal writing
Here are some useful links for proposal writing, primarily geared towards research grants. These can hopefully give you an idea on what to think about when writing a proposal, but note that not all of the points in these resources apply for the course project proposal.
