# Introduction


## Note are work-in-progress
These notes are under construction and are based on lectures from UW AA/EE/ME 548, taught by Karen Leung Spring 2023--now. These notes are based on scribe notes by students from Spring 2023.
Since these notes are brand new, you may find typos and errors. If you do, please send an email to `aa548-spr25-staff@uw.edu` or submit a pull request with the fixes to the Github repository.
